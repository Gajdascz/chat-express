**Live Preview:** ðŸš§ Migrating from Railway

## User

A user is any individual currently accessing the application.

### Registration

Registering allows a user to send messages and potentially upgrade to member status.

- **Optional:** avatar image, first name, last name, email
- **Required:** username, password, password confirmation
  - _Provided password is hashed before being stored on the database and the confirmation is deleted immediately after it's validated._

### Status

User status defines the level of access a user has to the app's data and features.

- **Anonymous (not registered)**
  - View message history with redacted usernames and timestamps.
  - Register for an account.
- **Basic (registered)**
  - View message history with redacted usernames and timestamps.
  - Send Messages.
  - Upgrade to Member by answering the question in the `profile` page correctly.
- **Member**

  - Send Messages.
  - Update user avatar once every 12 hours.
- **Admin**

  - Can do everything any other user can as well as delete messages.

## Learning Outcome

<details><summary> New</summary>

- **Authentication**
  - Configured and deployed a local authentication strategy using the `Passport.js` middleware.
    - Paired with `express-session` to persist authentication state across sessions.
    - Set up route authorization to securely control user access.
    - Implemented `bcrypt` password hashing.

    - Completed the "_Introduction to Cloudinary for Node.js Developers (90-Minute Course)_"
    - Leveraged transforms and inline CDN imports for efficient image storage, caching, and serving.
- **File Uploading**
  - **Multer:** Incorporated the `multer` middleware to parse image file uploads (multipart/form-data)
    - Stored the Buffer object containing the binary data in local memory.
  - **Streamifier:** Used `streamifier` to create a readable stream from the Multer Buffer Object.
    - Piped the stream data directly to cloudinary storage.
- **Handlebars**
  - **Configuration:** Configured and utilized the `Handlebars` template engine for server-side rendering.
  - **Features Used:** Partials, Layouts, and various Block/Built-in/Custom helpers.
- **Obscenity:** Integrated the Obscenity library to censor explicit messages.
